# AT web

This is the source for AT website. It uses bun and 11ty, so what you need to do is:

1. `git clone` the repo in a folder of your choosing
2. install bun by following the instructions [here](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
3. move in the `web` folder with `cd web`
4. install this project dependencies by running `bun install`

After you've done all of the above, running a live preview of the website is as simple as:

```shell
bun start
```

Have fun hacking!
