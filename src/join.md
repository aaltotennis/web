## Old members

Starting from January 2021, the old membership cards (PDF-files) won’t work for proving your membership. We’re switching to using membership cards that the Finnish Tennis Association offers through TennisClub [www.tennisclub.fi/pelaaja](https://www.tennisclub.fi/pelaaja). If you don’t pay the membership fee, you will no longer be a member of Aalto Tennis.

Updating member information:

If your contact information or member status changes (e.g. you graduate), you should change your information in TennisClub.

## Membership card

To find your membership card, login to TennisClub [www.tennisclub.fi/pelaaja](https://www.tennisclub.fi/pelaaja) with the login-information you received to your email. You can find the card under the “jäsenkortti”-tab.

You can also download Oma Tennis app from your App Store and login to TennisClub from there.

Unfortunately the system is in Finnish, if you have trouble using it please contact us at [aaltotennis@gmail.com](mailto:aaltotennis@gmail.com) or Instagram and we will help!
