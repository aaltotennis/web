Aalto Tennis, formerly known as Teekkaritennis is a student association under Aalto University. The club was founded in 1965 by a group of students from Helsinki University of Technology, but nowadays students and graduates from all universities are welcome to join the club! Aalto Tennis is also an official tennis club approved by the Finnish Tennis Association.

Our activity varies from year to year. Throughout the years we have organized tennis courses, tournaments, game days, trips and get-togethers. Our club consists of players ranging from beginners to national level competitive players, so you will surely find playing partners of your own level!
